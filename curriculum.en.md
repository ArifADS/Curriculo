## About me
I started to learn programming with a scripting language called AutoIt, for Windows, then I changed to macOS and I started on iOS Development with a personal app named "Beisbol Hoy", or "Baseball Today" in english, when iOS 7 landed in 2013, written in Obj-C but the next year I changed it to Swift 1.

Later, I moved to Panama and worked as a freelance, I developed an app named "RTC GPS" that uses Google Maps services and a GPS installed in a vehicle, so you can have basic controls of its location, ignition, etc. It later integrated Bluetooth that calculates proximity and keyless door opening. After that I worked in a company named Pineapple Technologies for about 20 months, I developed a great Point Of Sale with inventory management and integration with Fiscal Printers through a Rasperry Pi (Invu POS).

Meanwhile since I have always made the backends for my personal projects, I started to learn Node.js, changing from the ageing PHP, which worked perfect for the server I installed in the Rasperry Pi projects.
