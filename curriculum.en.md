## About me
I began my programming journey with AutoIt, a scripting language for Windows, which sparked my interest in software development. When I transitioned to macOS, I dove into iOS development, creating my first personal app, Beisbol Hoy (“Baseball Today”), when iOS 7 launched in 2013. Initially written in Objective-C, I rewrote it in Swift the following year, embracing the new language and its evolving capabilities.

After relocating to Panama, I expanded my expertise through freelance work. One notable project was RTC GPS, an app integrating Google Maps and GPS systems to provide real-time vehicle tracking, along with features like proximity-based Bluetooth control and keyless entry. My work in Panama eventually led me to Pineapple Technologies, where I spent over a year and a half developing a robust Point of Sale system (Invu POS). This project, which included inventory management and integration with fiscal printers via Raspberry Pi, was an incredible learning experience and remains a highlight of my career.

Currently based in Madrid, I’m deeply focused on advancing my skills in iOS development, particularly with Swift and SwiftUI. I am passionate about adopting best practices and continuously evolving with the latest advancements in the software developing world.
