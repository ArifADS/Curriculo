## About Me

I am a seasoned iOS engineer with over a decade of experience, ranging from Objective-C and UIKit to modern SwiftUI and async/await. I started my programming journey with AutoIt and quickly transitioned into mobile development, building my first app — Beisbol Hoy — in 2013. Since then, I've contributed to various impactful products across multiple domains, from consumer-facing marketplaces to internal enterprise tools.

My freelance work led to full-time roles where I specialized in complex integrations like Bluetooth, geolocation, and fiscal printing. Notably, I developed a robust iOS Point of Sale system (Invu POS) integrated with Raspberry Pi for hardware control. After moving to Spain, I worked on scaling grocery and qCommerce apps like Lola Market and Glovo, leading initiatives to modernize legacy codebases and implement SwiftUI architectures.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, and currently focused on scalable SwiftUI architecture, performance and modularization, I value clean and maintainable code, and enjoy collaborating across disciplines to create seamless product experiences.
